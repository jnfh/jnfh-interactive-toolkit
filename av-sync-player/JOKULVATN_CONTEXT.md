# AV Spatial Mixer - Context for Jokulvatn Supporting Text

## Quick Summary

The AV Spatial Mixer is an interactive web-based player that transforms the 46-minute Jokulvatn composition into a navigable soundscape. Instead of linear playback, listeners explore the glacier's sounds by moving their cursor across a canvas, with each field recording location responding to proximity—creating an immersive, spatial experience of the melting Icelandic glacier.

## Key Points for Supporting Text

### The Experience
- **Interactive Exploration:** Users navigate through the soundscape by moving their cursor, discovering different aspects of the glacier's sounds
- **Spatial Audio:** Each field recording location is positioned on a 2D canvas, with audio volume responding to proximity in real-time
- **Visual-Audio Connection:** Visual elements react to the actual sounds playing, creating a tangible relationship between what you hear and see
- **Immersive Mode:** Minimal interface allows focus on the soundscape; controls auto-hide for distraction-free listening
- **Sweet Spot:** Center position provides balanced, full-spectrum experience where all sounds play together at boosted volume

### Technical Capabilities
- Handles 46-minute duration efficiently (streaming, not full file loading)
- Multiple synchronized audio tracks (one per field recording location)
- Multi-layer video compositing (base glacier footage + transparent overlays)
- Real-time spatial audio processing using 3D HRTF (binaural audio through headphones)
- Smooth synchronization across all media
- Web-based, no installation required

### How It Works for Jokulvatn
- Each field recording becomes an audio source positioned on the canvas
- Moving toward ice sounds reveals cracking, melting details
- Moving toward water sounds reveals flow and movement
- Moving toward wind/environment sounds reveals atmospheric textures
- Center position provides the full, balanced composition
- Visual elements pulse and react based on actual glacier sounds

### User Journey
1. **Load:** Player loads configuration and media files
2. **Play:** All audio sources and video layers start simultaneously
3. **Explore:** User moves cursor to discover different sound perspectives
4. **Discover:** Each movement reveals new aspects of the glacier environment
5. **Immerse:** Hide controls, go fullscreen, focus entirely on the soundscape

### Unique Aspects
- **Non-Linear:** Users can explore different parts of the soundscape at will
- **Personal:** Each listening session can be unique based on exploration path
- **Spatial:** Creates sense of navigating physical space, not just listening to time
- **Reactive:** Visual feedback responds to actual audio, not artificial animations
- **Contemplative:** Designed for deep, focused listening experiences

### Metaphorical Connections
- **Navigation:** Moving through the soundscape mirrors moving through the physical glacier
- **Proximity:** Getting closer to sounds mirrors getting closer to recording locations
- **Discovery:** Exploring reveals hidden aspects, like exploring the glacier itself
- **Presence:** Spatial audio creates sense of "being there" at the glacier
- **Transformation:** The melting glacier transforms over time; the soundscape transforms through exploration

## Suggested Themes for Supporting Text

### Exploration & Discovery
- Emphasize the interactive nature—users actively explore rather than passively consume
- Highlight how each movement reveals different aspects of the glacier
- Connect to the idea of field recording as exploration

### Spatial Presence
- Describe the sense of navigating physical space
- Connect spatial audio to sense of place
- Emphasize the immersive, "being there" quality

### Environmental Connection
- Link the interactive exploration to environmental awareness
- Connect the melting glacier theme to the spatial experience
- Emphasize how the tool makes environmental sounds tangible

### Temporal & Spatial
- Contrast traditional linear time-based listening with spatial exploration
- Describe how the 46-minute duration becomes a navigable space
- Connect to the glacier's transformation over time

### Technology & Nature
- Frame the technology as enhancing, not replacing, the natural sounds
- Emphasize how spatial audio creates deeper connection to place
- Connect web-based accessibility to global environmental awareness

## Technical Terms (Use Sparingly)

- **Spatial Audio:** 3D audio positioning that creates sense of space
- **HRTF:** Head-Related Transfer Function (creates realistic binaural audio)
- **Field Recordings:** Recordings made in the actual environment
- **Canvas:** The 2D space where audio sources are positioned
- **Sweet Spot:** The center position where all sounds are balanced
- **Fade Radius:** The distance at which sounds fade away

## Avoid Technical Jargon

Instead of technical terms, use descriptive language:
- "Audio sources positioned in space" not "HRTF spatialization"
- "Sounds respond to your movement" not "distance-based volume algorithm"
- "Visual elements react to sound" not "AnalyserNode frequency data"
- "Navigable soundscape" not "2D canvas coordinate system"

## Emotional Tone Suggestions

- **Contemplative:** Emphasize the meditative, focused listening experience
- **Immersive:** Describe the sense of being transported to the glacier
- **Exploratory:** Frame as a journey of discovery
- **Environmental:** Connect to climate change, melting glaciers, transformation
- **Intimate:** Describe the personal, unique experience each user creates
- **Spatial:** Emphasize the sense of navigating physical space
